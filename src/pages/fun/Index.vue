I use a chrome extension to save the links to a Notion database, but rarely get around to reading them. Just glancing at the <span class="font-mono">>400</span class="font-mono"> articles in there makes me shiver, so I got <span class="font-mono">gpt-4o</span> to summarise most of them, and built this front-end to bubble up one at random, with estimated reading time and a few tags.

        description:
          "I noticed that some of Paul Graham's essays had translations in other languages. Not all of them were translated, and some of the translations were incomplete or dead links altogether. I decided to create a website that hosted translations of all his essays, translated into 8 langugages, using 4 LLMs. I imagined that the people that would find this most useful were those that weren't aware of browser's in-built translation features, so I heavily optimised for SEO and performance in Next.js with SSG. Learned a lot about SEO and performance in the process. ",
