    <p>Welcome to my plot of internet real estate!</p>
    <p>
      I studied Engineering Design at the University of Bristol; a sort of
      'liberal arts' for Engineering. I enjoyed working on projects across a
      bunch of fields; from operations research to computer vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, I picked up programming, and began incorporating it in as many
      projects as I could.
