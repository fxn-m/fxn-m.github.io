        <h3 id="i-m-a-software-design-engineer-">I&#39;m a Software &amp;&amp; Design Engineer.</h3>
        <p>Studied Engineering Design at the University of Bristol; a sort of 'liberal arts' for Engineering.</p>
        <p>I worked on projects across a bunch of fields; from operations research to computer vision.</p>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies, my bachelor's thesis focused on automating the disassembly of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for cell re-purposing.</p>
        <p>Later, with my master's project team, we designed a universal LIB interface. The aim was to make it easier to reuse batteries transitioning from their first lives in transport, to stationary storage.</p>
        <p>At some point I picked up programming, starting with data science & ML projects. I'm self-taught and now learning full-stack, improving patient education in healthcare @ <a href="https://www.sanctuaryhealth.io/"
                target="_blank">Sanctuary Health</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm based in Cambridge, travelling through late 2023. In 2024 I'll be in London.</p>
